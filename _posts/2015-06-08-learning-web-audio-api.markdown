Hey there! Thank you for visiting [Sonoport](http://sonoport.com/)'s tech blog! We hope that you had a wonderful weekend! This week we would like to shed some light on [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) by pointing out the different sources available on the net where you can learn more about it (there are so many!), different examples of its many uses and tips on learning it as a non-developer without any background in coding.

Firstly we would like to show you some cool examples of what **Web Audio API** is capable of and how creative developers are using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to design and implement it. However before that, what you should do is to check whether your browser is compatible with Web Audio API using this [chart](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api) or else you might be wondering why are there no sounds coming out from the websites.

If you would like to have more news on Web Audio API and more, you can either go to our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sonoport), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sonoport), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sonoport-asia-pte-ltd) for daily updates or other Web Audio news sites such as [AudioCrawl](http://audiocrawl.co/) and [Web Audio Weekly](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw.html) where you can also sign up for newsletters.

<h3><span style="color:#425C70">Web Audio API</span></h3>

The **Web Audio API** is a high-level **Javascript API** for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. So what is an API? It stands for **Application Programming Inferface** and it is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. If you are interested, a good explanation of an API would be [here](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/api-good-technology-explained/). 

So what **Web Audio API** helps us to do is to control audio in browsers. A more detailed description of Web Audio API by Boris Smus is [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/). In Chapter 1, Boris Smus explains to us briefly about the history of audio on the web and it will help you to understand the limitations of web audio before **Web Audio API** was created.

Don't worry if you are still unsure about what exactly Web Audio API does and how to implement it because there is a learning curve but with patience and loads of research you should be able to grasp it in no time!

### <span style="color:#425C70">Learning Web Audio API as a Non-Developer</span>

There are several ways to start learning about Web Audio API. If you do have a basic knowledge of how audio signal flow works, routing it, and what do filters do..etc you can start by playing with this [Web Audio Tool](http://www.webaudiotool.com/) where you can visually see what is going on and experiment with the tools available. After you are done creating your patch, you can also generate the code for it to study or keep for your own reference.

If you come from absolutely zero knowledge of audio signal flow, you can start by watching these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-v75Mgh9dA&list=PLRwSxn6RVkVIM9443VFgYHNkYuqbmEakk) by Academy AV. After that, you should be able to understand several concepts on audio signal flow and play around with the Web Audio Tool that I have linked above.

As a starter, it would also be useful to get basic knowledge of Javascript first in order to understand the lines of codes and learn how to do simple programming. Depending on which learning methods are more preferable for you, for video tutorials there are websites such as [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) and [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/default.aspx) (Each of them has a 10 day free trial which you can try). For interactive learning there are [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [Codeavengers](http://www.codeavengers.com/).

To just jump straight into learning about Web Audio API, you can begin by going through the [Web Audio School](http://mmckegg.github.io/web-audio-school/) which features simple tutorials for you to do. 

Once you are comfortable enough to start experimenting on your own, you can start by using online tools such as [JSfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), [Codepen](Codepen.io), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [Github](https://github.com/). If you would like to have more options, there're several other links available below for your own resources. We hope that this article was helpful for you and wish you a wonderful learning journey onwards.
