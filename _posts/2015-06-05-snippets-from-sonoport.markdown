<p>Hi all! Greetings from the <a href="http://sonoport.com/">Sonoport</a> team! If you have been following our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sonoport">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sonoport">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sonoport-asia-pte-ltd">LinkedIn</a> accounts you would have noticed our daily posts on anything related to sound and exciting developments from other creative teams around the world. It's about time we show you a tiny snippet of what our team has been working on. To do that here is a quick recap of our mission.</p>

<font color="#94ABC1"><h3>What are we doing?</h3></font>

<p>We are a company that works with <b>Interactive Dynamic Audio for Multimedia</b> and we are currently building a <b>Smart Sound Exchange Platform</b> that will allow anybody to select audio from the world's largest internet sound archive, dynamically shape it with our <b>Sound Models</b> and output it as HTML code for use throughout the web.</p>

<font color="#94ABC1"><h3>What are Sound Models?</h3></font>

<p><b>Sound models</b> are parametereized algorithms which generate dynamic sounds in real time. One example of our <b>Sound Models</b> would be the Texture Based Models which uses some kind of audio source (mp3, wav audio files) compared to Algorithmic Models which uses the method of physical modelling synthesis.</p>

<p>Here is an example: <a href="http://sonoport.github.io/jsmplayer/">JSM Player</a></p>

<font color="#5680B0"><h3>How does the JSM Player work?</h3></font>

<p>You can use the JSM Player to load an audio file from your computer or an url and manipulate the sounds using the faders with the parameters given.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Looper:</b> Loops the audio source continuously. Also supports looping of multiple source synchronously.</li>
  <li><b>Trigger:</b> Triggers a single playback of the audio source. Supports multiple voices and multiple simulteanous playbacks.</li>
  <li><b>MultiTrigger:</b> Triggers a repeated playback of the audio source.</li>
  <li><b>Activity:</b> Change the playback speed on an audio source based on the rate of change of a parameter.</li>
  <li><b>Scrubber:</b> Allows for 'scrubbing' of the audio source by changing which part of the audio source is being played.</li>
  <li><b>Extender:</b> Extends an audio source inifinitely without making it feel repeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Sound Models</b> we have are <a href="https://github.com/sonoport/soundmodels">open source</a>!</p>
